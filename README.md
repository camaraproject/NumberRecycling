# NumberRecycling

Sandbox API Repository to describe, develop, document, and test the NumberRecycling API within the [Know Your Customer (KYC)](https://lf-camaraproject.atlassian.net/wiki/x/I4DGB) Sub Project.

* API Repository [wiki page](https://lf-camaraproject.atlassian.net/wiki/x/ggCaBQ)

## Scope

* Service API “NumberRecycling” (see [APIBacklog.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/APIBacklog/blob/main/documentation/APIbacklog.md))
* The API provides the API consumer with the ability to:  
  * Check whether the subscriber of the phone number has changed. A common scenario is when Application service provider (ASP) wants to check whether there has been a change in the user associated with the phone number after the specified date. This allows the ASP to ensure that a phone number is correctly linked to an user and prevent the mis-delivery of SMS messages.
* Describe, develop, document, and test the API
* Started: August 2024
