  title: Number Recycling
  description: |
    The API can be used to check whether the subscriber of the phone number has changed.
    A common scenario is when a fraudster obtains a phone number that previously belonged to another person who did not properly deactivate or verify it. The fraudster can then use this number to commit identity theft or engage in fraudulent activities, such as obtaining access codes for accounts associated with that number. In some cases, fraudsters may also attempt to use services or avoid charges by leveraging old, no longer used numbers that were previously used by other users.
    Response includes whether there will be changes from the specified date.

    ### Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details on how a client requests an access token. Please refer to Identify and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the Profile.

    Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco Operator exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric data control.
